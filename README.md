<h1>SpringMVCFilmCRUD</h1>


<h2>Description </h2>
This is a full stack Film query project that allows a user to filter through films within our database. When the app is launched, they are presented a main menu from which they can perform the following actions

<ul>
<li>Find a film using an ID number</li>
<li>Add a film of their choice</li>
<li>Delete a film</li>
<li>Search a film by a keyword</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

<ul>
<li>Spring Tool Suite</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>SQL</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Bootstrap</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
This was both of our's first paired program project, so there were some additional learning curves presented than just implementing a successful full-stack program.  

<ol>
<li>Effectively communicating to partner to ensure our program didn't crash</li>
<li>Autowiring instantiates our film dao</li>
<li>JSP's allow programmers to insert Java code inside of HTML, which is an advantage over regular HTML file</li>
<li>One missing link in the SQL can make or break one feature</li>
<li>   </li>
<li>   </li>
</ol>
