<h1>SpringMVCFilmCRUD</h1>


<h2>Description </h2>

This is a full stack (C.R.U.D.) Film query project that allows a user to filter through films within our database. When the app is launched, they are presented a main menu from which they can perform the following actions. The user will be given the option to update or delete films one various pages that display the film in which they can base their choice on. The user is given full range of inserting, deleting, and inserting films, these actions translate into the database.

<li>Find a film using an ID number</li>
<li>Add a film of their choice</li>
<li>Delete a film</li>
<li>Search a film by a keyword</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

<ul>
<li>Spring Tool Suite</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>SQL</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>Bootstrap</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
This was both of our's first paired program project, so there were some additional learning curves presented than just implementing a successful full-stack program.  

<ol>
<li>Effectively communicating to partner to ensure our program didn't crash</li>
<li>Autowiring instantiates our film dao</li>
<li>JSP's allow programmers to insert Java code inside of HTML, which is an advantage over regular HTML file.</li>
<ul>
<li>JSP are used for web applications that support dynamic content</li>	
</ul>
<li>One missing link in the SQL can make or break one feature</li>
<li>How to use bootstrap in HTML files</li>
<li>The flow of how the program works  </li>
<li>We didn't fully understand how to prevent duplicate POSTs, so we both have agreed that we would like to come back to this application to implement the proper way to redirect</li>
</ol>
